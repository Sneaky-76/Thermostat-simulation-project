# Thermostat-simulation-project
Course project for Computer Measurement Systems (2025/26), focused on designing and implementing a VI program in a graphical programming language environment - LabView. The final goal of the project was to develop a fully functional thermostat simulation for setting a certain temperature in a given room with an additional natural cooling effect. It makes use of clusters, bundles, logical conditions, timing manipulation, different structures and much more in order to achieve the desired outcome.
