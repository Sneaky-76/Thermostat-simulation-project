Welcome to a quick guide on how to use the VI presented in this GitHub repository.

Prerequisites: installed LabView (preferably version 2025+)

On opening the .vi file the user is met with the device's front panel of the project, which displays:
- current temperature [Celsius]
- desired/set temperature [Celsius]
- room name
- room numer
- current date & time of the device
- heat on/off LED indicator for a specific room

The white arrow in the top left corner of the project shall be pressed in order to start the program.

Controls:

[>] Right pointing arrow = cycling between the rooms in ascending order
[<] Left pointing arrow = cycling between the rooms in descending order
[^] Up pointing arrow = incrementating the desired room temperature by 0.1
[⌄] Down pointing arrow = decrementing the desired room temperature by 0.1
[o] The circular-shaped button = stopping the program
